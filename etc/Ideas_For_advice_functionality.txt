pseudo-code:

Give advice(interval):
	# retrieve data from database on weekly basis
	data = get data records from database within the interval of start(7 days ago) to today
	# calculate the summary of the data
	food_cal = sum the calorie of food in the interval
	sport_cal = sum the calorie of sport in the interval
	# assign levels to the food and activity
	food_lvl = assign level based on the food_cal
		<=2499       = level -1
		2500 - 2699 = level 0
		2700 - 2899 = level 1
		2900 - 3099 = level 2
		>=3100       = level 3
	sport_lvl = assign level based on the sport_cal
		0 - 199 > level 0
		200-399 > level 1
		400-699 > level 2
		700+    > level 3
	# give advice based on levels; levels correspond as follows:
	advice = generate advice based on food_lvl and sport_lvl
	total_level = sport_lvl - food_lvl
